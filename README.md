# Churn_model

## A churn model is a mathematical representation of how churn impacts your business. Churn calculations are built on existing data (the number of customers who     left your service during a given time period). A predictive churn model extrapolates on this data to show future potential churn rates.

## Here we are using a churn model to determine the possibility of an employee to leave the job or not using the concept of deeplearning.

## This is a basic model that can be further developed and be used by corporations to prrdict whether employees are going to leave their company or not.
